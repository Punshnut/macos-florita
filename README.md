# Florita - Alpha 0.1 üåø

Hola y welcome to the very first bloom of Florita, a cozy macOS 14+ SwiftUI app that brings a tiny desktop garden to life. This alpha build focuses on warmth, simple care rituals, and a little bit of everyday calma while we prepare the soil for future features.

## What's Growing Right Now
- SwiftUI-powered macOS app with a gentle pastel design and a shape-based plant (animated or static - your choice).
- Daily watering ritual: tap the in-app button to keep growth steady - never any penalties.
- Mini window (widget-sized) that mirrors the cozy view, perfect for parking on a corner of your desktop.
- Shared `@AppStorage` persistence so the main view and mini window stay in sync.
- Optional, soundless notification nudging you around 09:00 to water Florita.
- Settings window with controls for animation toggle, window size (cozy vs. roomy), and background style (pastel, plain, transparent).
- First-run onboarding walkthrough covering watering, customization, and reminders.
- Unit tests validating growth thresholds and calendar-day comparisons.

## Getting Started
1. Open `Florita.xcodeproj` in Xcode 15 or newer (macOS 14 SDK).
2. Select the **Florita** scheme and run on ‚ÄúMy Mac (macOS 14+)‚Äù.
3. On first launch, follow or skip the intro to learn the basics.
4. Use the Window menu to open ‚ÄúFlorita Mini‚Äù for a floating widget-sized companion.

## Scripts & Extras
- Watch a perpetual growth loop with `swift Scripts/AnimatedPlantDemo.swift`.

## Status & Hopes
